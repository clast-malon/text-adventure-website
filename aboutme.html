            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Stuart Clague. I have a degree in Molecular Cell Biology, and I have mostly worked in hospital laboratories performing sample analysis and administration.

            <h2>My Early Interest in I.T.</h2>
            <p> 
                I was always interested in IT, I built my first PC from parts when I was 14, but I did not consider it as a career; I think just because at my school not much effort was put into our "Computing" classes. Computers there would take 15 minutes to boot up, and often you could spend the other half of the lesson waiting for the computer to complete a relatively simple operation (like, opening a document). In the meantime I was developing an interest in science.
                <br><br>
                During my laboratory work I discovered I had a knack for creating formulas in Excel to increase efficiency; my greatest contribution was I found a way to fully automate a task that was previously taking 2 hours every day (and prone to error), which as far as I know is still in use. Later when I was given the responsibility of reporting on the accuracy of our tests, I discovered problems in the Excel workbook which meant we had been reporting incorrect figures for the last 5 years.
                <br><br>
                Not long after, I left that section, and started a different (but similar) role in the same organisation. This was a temporary role I could have continued if I had wanted, but I decided not to after I found a way to greatly increase productivity across the entire Pathology department (affecting approximately 500 people), but it was rejected because my new manager didn’t know what a “Macro” was. I had already created the macros to demonstrate their function, and I am sure there were other people I could have taken the idea to, but I was feeling quite despondent with the organisation by then, so I left.

            <h2>Developing a Career in I.T. (the current plan)</h2>
            <p>    
                I think the issue was, I was in the wrong job. I was supposed to be analysing samples (which I still did – all the extra work was done out of hours), so I can understand how someone in my position putting forward suggestions for the IT department would not be taken seriously.
                <br><br>
                I am now looking to get involved in IT. I have attempted (without success) to find a job as a Data Analyst (because I know I could do the job with my background), but now that I have started learning how to program with Python during a code bootcamp at <a href = "https://wearecodenation.com/" target = "_blank"> Code Nation</a>, I have decided I would enjoy programming more anyway.
                I intend to post any projects I complete on this website.
