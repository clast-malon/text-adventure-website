            <h3>About the Game</h3>
            <p>The story will be something space based, but very different from my previous game "2024"</p>
            <h3>Further Info</h3>
            <p>
                The mechanics of the game will be very different - instead of a linear progression, you will be able to choose which direction to go, walk back and forth, pick up objects etc.. Also as this game will be much longer, there will be a save code system included, so you don't need to finish the game all in 1 go.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also intend to include more text art of a better quality. All the games up to this point were intended to be played in a python terminal that takes up about half the screen, but if I can get the games working either through <a href = "https://trinket.io/home" target = _blank>Trinket</a> or embed the Python code myself, I could launch the games in a full screen, allowing for a lot more space!
