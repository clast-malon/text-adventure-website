            This is a simple text adventure game made over 3 days by a team of 3 people during a code bootcamp at <a href = "https://wearecodenation.com/" target ="_blank"> Code Nation</a>. It's fairly linear once you start a story path, but there are 2 main paths to choose at the start and lots of different endings.

            <h3>About the Game</h3>
            <p>
                You've made some bad decisions in your life but taking part in this SOMNOS trial and trapping yourself within your own subconscious may be the worst one yet! Journey through your strange and, frankly, twisted mind as you try to escape from your self-entrapment. How do you achieve this? By making good decisions of course! But judging by the fact that you essentially chose to put yourself in this predicament in the first place... may mean that you'll remain trapped within... THE DREAMCATCHER
